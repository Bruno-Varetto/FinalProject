## **_Description_**

The project demonstates a smart automation infrastructure. It is built in hierarchy order of modules. The modules contain number of classes with methods.
In this way, the tests can be created in very simple way with a minimum lines of code.
Also the infrastructure allows to work with differend kinds of applications.
